# Writing scripts

- Always use bun and modern typescript
- Always add comprehensive (clear and concise) logging to make it easy to see what the script is doing
- Use emojis (sparingly) for easy visual scanning of loglines
- Make sure we are not logging duplicate or redundant loglines
- When you add logs for debugging, prefix them with [DEBUG]
- Always add a progress indicator for long operations where progress is known (e.g. repeatedly processing a list of items)
